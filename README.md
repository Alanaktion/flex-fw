# Flex Framework

A minimal CSS framework built on Flexbox

This is more of a proof-of-concept than a usable framework for now, but it's a great way to get familiar with the basics of flexbox and building a dynamically generated grid system.

## Compiling

Requires [node](https://nodejs.org) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com).

```bash
cd assets/
npm install
gulp
```

For development, use `gulp watch`, which will recompile the CSS whenever a `.scss` file is modified.
